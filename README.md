### 8-BIT CPU ###

I had problems understanding assembly, bare metal programming, and low level C
So yeah, I will go from a 8-bit to ai 16 and later 32-bit CPU on Logisim, understand registers
and other stuff in depth. Then i have planned to study kernel develoment.

To build a nice fundamentals  and improve my programming with C/C++
